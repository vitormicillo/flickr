# flickr
test application with flickr API

In the API URL I am using the link and the tags that you have passed me as a guide.

I inserted a button to request more images through AJAX requests, I placed a limit of 16 photos per request, but when there are no more photos the button disappears to indicate that there is nothing left to load.

The code is very simple and objective, it is focused on what was requested.
